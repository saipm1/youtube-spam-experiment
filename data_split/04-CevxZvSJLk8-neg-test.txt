Glad to know im not the only one who knows its katheryn's birthday today :)  happy birthday katy...and my sister. (they seriously have the same  birthday...)ï»¿
Katy Perry can't sing for shit. All i hear it autotune.ï»¿
I fucking hate her. Why? Because she don't write her songs she got  producers for that. Second why tha fack is she in every song almost nude  mayby because she's an attention hooker.ï»¿
Put famous people in the jungle for an hour and look what happens.ï»¿
She kinda let herself go, huh?ï»¿
we all love you Katy Perry &lt;3ï»¿
Love it when I can relate to my daughter's music. :-) Katy Perry - Roar  (Official): http://youtu.be/CevxZvSJLk8ï»¿

ÎŸh my god ... Roar is the most liked video at Vevo .. while 2 months ago  was Justin's Baby.. congrats Katy . Applause &lt;3 ï»¿
I'd rather hear some propa explicit gangsta rap insted of this garbage.  This song is trash !ï»¿
DAMNNNNNNNN, she is sexy O_Oï»¿
I LOVE YOU!!! Because u make me smile when im sad you cheer me up with your  beautiful songs (: &lt;3ï»¿
This song is the most boring, asinine song I have ever heard. Coming from a  guy who liked "Teenage Dream" (the song). Ever since Katy Perry's divorce  it's wave after wave of shitty but successful songs... For those of you  saying "This is the next wave of pop music". Stick it up your ass. Katy  Perry is like Silly Putty. ï»¿
Katy Perry - Roar (Official): http://youtu.be/CevxZvSJLk8. I love this song  and video Katy Perry Rocks Wahoo! ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜˜ï»¿
And somehow she has access to makeup in the middle of the woods...ï»¿
It looks so real and my daughter is a big fan and she likes a lot of your  songs.ï»¿
I can't comprehend why this video has nearly 700,000,000 views. Some people  found 'Gangnam Style' funny so that explains its high view count but this  is just an awful pop song. I really have no clue on this one.ï»¿
Lets be honest, you wouldn't last 1 day on your own in the jungle. Stop  living n a fairy world.ï»¿
Nature is beautiful, no need to place tits in video to impress people.ï»¿
This is so stupid. If you Roared at a Lion in real life you'd dedeï»¿
This song is so AWESOME!!!She made everything stand out and all the viewers  could imagine themselves at the setting of the video. Awesome Job Katy  Perry!!!!ï»¿

Katy Perry is lionï»¿
I've figured out why I dislike this song: it's supposed to be a power  ballad right? Something that's uplifting and motivating by the end.  However, the final chorus has NO extra UMPH at the end and actually sounds  just like the first one. Instead of crescendo-ing into a powerful finish,  "Roar" just says on the same wavelength. It falls flat.ï»¿
i like this song the video goes perfect with itï»¿
"....because I AM a champion...and you're gonna hear me roar!"   Today I AM my own champion  Today I AM a champion for the Creator  Today I AM doing positive in my world Today I AM blessing and healing all around me Today I AM successful and  creating success  ï»¿
Katy Perry's songs are the best of the songs of women artists.ï»¿
i like this song because of all the animals and i like this song .ï»¿
I love this song so much!:-D I've heard it so much I pretty much memorized  the lyricsï»¿

I hate videos like these with those poor animals.ï»¿
