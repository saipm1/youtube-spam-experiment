katy perry does remind me of a tiger,like as if its her spirit animal :3 &lt;3﻿
In what South American jungle or any jungle for that matter do you find an  African elephant and a bengal tiger in the same place. Who made this video.﻿
Its a good song and i like her video clip, because its a bout a girl that  her airplane crashed on a land far far away... and she found the way to  survive! And i love the pet tiget too( Kitty Purpy) lol :D﻿
Thanks to this video we know that Nokia phones can survive a plane crash.﻿
She named the tiger Kitty Purry  No, seriously, she did, check the video ﻿
Perfect! &lt;3﻿
And after the video ends, a 13 ft. boa constrictor squeezes her to death.﻿
should not have paused the music, this is a clip, not a movie.﻿
I love this song, it´s for empowering every woman :)  "you´re gonna hear me roar" ;)﻿
This song makes me want to drink bleach﻿
If she really did this there she's hardcore﻿
I'm sorry Katy Perry, I was being weird. I still love you &lt;3﻿
I'm not a big fan of the song but this video is awesome!﻿

I    loved        it           so       much          because         you          get         to         stand            fear .﻿
3:46 so cute!﻿
i think they were drunk when they shot the first half of the video and then the sec on half comes in, and her boobs are magically bigger and  she's more beautiful suddenly, and the dude practically vanishes ﻿
Roar is without a doubt your best song...feel good song with a message for  everyone. Good job Katy﻿
The great mother of the jungle. Sweet and natural. I like her videos.﻿

There is 7 bilion poeple on earth Now stop being dumb﻿
I love this shit but I disliked it because it's sucks﻿
this video is very inaccurate, a tiger would rip her face of﻿
Are those real animals﻿
Maybe the best music video in the last 15 years? This is how pop music is  done folks!﻿
I love KATY PERRY &lt;3 &lt;3﻿
Boooobs﻿
I really don't understand how this has 600 million views lol. I'm not  hating or anything, it's just confusing. ﻿

My telephone!﻿
This comment will randomly get lot's of likes and replies for no reason. I  also like Jello. Strawberry jello.﻿
really want this video to get 1 billion views, would be amazing!﻿
I started hating Katy Perry after finding out that she stole all of the  ideas on her videos  from an old comic book. Yet, her music is catchy. ﻿
How can this song have 629 million views while there are only 7 million  people in the world?﻿
Katy Perry is garbage. Rihanna is the best singer in the world. ﻿
Katy Perry is part of me Katy Perry is my firework Katy Perry, I love you﻿
This Song Was Good Until It Got Overplayed The Hell Out Of On Radio﻿
see it all, human folly right?﻿
Great.This is a song﻿
Awesum song!! Jus luv it!﻿
Imagine this in the news crazy woman found acting like a tiger and bit jims  ear off﻿
selfie alert﻿
Your going to hear me Roar !!!! :-))))   #soundsofsunday ﻿
It is a shit﻿
i am a big fan of you and i love you﻿
I &lt;3 Katy Perry!﻿
Since she is a feminist champion, why would she want to reinforce the  stereotype of girls being girly by painting the nails of an elephant that  probably wouldn't even appreciate it?﻿
This is fucking shit. From the first notes, that becomes clear. Complete  and utter shit. May God come and cleanse the earth of the complete and  utter idiocy which is humankind.﻿
At least she didn't get rid of her completely useless makeup.﻿
I love roar and Katy Perry. She is my favorite singer and sometimes I just  mute the volume and look at her!﻿
This is the best of the best video in world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!﻿
She's got it all. Incredible voice, extremely hot, nice tits﻿
I really like this song.﻿
my son love so much﻿
Y LOVE YOU﻿
why the elephant have a broken horn﻿
Where did she find all that make up in a freakin jungle?!﻿
so cute that monkey *-*! ﻿
Nice song﻿
You are all sheep, period. This is terrible music.﻿
In the beginning she was scared off everything and next thing you know she  is out in a leopard bikini!﻿
I love her green eyes﻿
How old is Katy perry?﻿

NOKIA spotted﻿
I hear this all the time on radio and its really irritating. That being  said, i like the video﻿

If only I had the body like Katy Perry :)). She looks so hot. I love her  ^^!﻿
The song is very good ...but the video makes no sense...just a nonsense  video...I mean she is telling her story of being stuck on an island, but  the song doesn't fit in the situation...but nvm...The song is good﻿
Who else would give Katy perry a good old mighty roar? ;)﻿
OMG I LOVE YOU KATY PARRY YOUR SONGS ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THATS A TOTAL  SUBSCRIBE﻿
Katy Perry - Roar (Official): http://youtu.be/CevxZvSJLk8﻿
katy perry is awesome﻿
I love this sooooooooooooong I love katy perry﻿
What does that tattoo on her right tricep say?﻿
Since when has Katy Perry had her own YouTube channel?﻿
Every time I watch this mv I just so so so glad that I live in a world that  don't have to worry about running from a real, human eating tiger.﻿
"eye of the tiger" "i am the champion" seems like katy perry is using  titles of old rock songs for lyrics..﻿
She is a perfect wonder.....﻿
she is horrible at acting. cringe-worhty.﻿
Is that tiger called 'Katty Purry'?﻿
blue eyes, can't be trusted.  uranus bless america.﻿
Katy Perry - Roar (Official): http://youtu.be/CevxZvSJLk8﻿
C'mon Katy you are so close to 14,000,000 subscribers...come up with  another hit like this and it will happen﻿
My honest opinion. It's a very mediocre song. Nothing unique or special  about her music, lyrics or voice. Nothing memorable like Billie Jean or  Beat It. Before her millions of fans reply with hate comments, i know this  is a democracy and people are free to see what they want. But then don't I  have the right to express my opinion? Please don't reply with dumb comments  lie "if you don't like it don't watch it". I just came here to see what's  the buzz about(661 million views??) and didn't like what i saw. OK?﻿
Wow she is sexy XD﻿
Katy has a voice of an Angel﻿
This video is so racist!!! There are only animals.﻿
Man she is BEAUTIFUL!﻿
Yesterday this video have 1 million likes and now it has 2 million﻿
why tiger succumbs to a beautiful girl ?.probably male tiger.....????   ha.ha.ha..﻿
Best song ever ﻿
She is good. Does she make any more music? If she doesn't, she should!﻿
I LOVE YOU KATTY PERRY &lt;3 ﻿
HONESTLY, I WANNA SEE YOU BE BRAVE! oh wait...﻿
;-)﻿
this video is great .....!!! I love this........and like much katy perry﻿
Good thing she brought her spray-on tan, hairstylist, makeup artist, and  cameraman.﻿
666,002,018 views! 666 million. 666! Katy Perry illuminati confirmed!!!﻿
It should be illegal to be this goodlooking as this babe is...﻿
katy is mine the girl of my dreams ♥﻿
I love this song﻿
She is fit﻿
I love the song roar it make me think am fill the way﻿
How do you forget you have a choice, and what the fuck, surviving a plane  crash has a 1/1000 chance of happening.﻿
she is a fool. this is a foolish video. the lyrics are all about her and  how great she is. she is arrogant, obviously. but the thing is that there  are a lot of idiots.. look how many hits this garnered. the young stupid  girls who listen to her are numbering in the millions i guess. this video  is a piece of trash. why would anyone ever like it or listen to it? because  these stupid little girls have idiots for fathers and mothers.. and so they  are going to turn into idiots also.. just like this stupid singer. ﻿
I just realized that this verses in this song have the exact same melody as  the verses in "Hey Ho" by the Lumineers.﻿
