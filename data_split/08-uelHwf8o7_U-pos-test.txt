3 yrs ago I had a health scare but thankfully I’m okay. I realized I wasn’t living life to the fullest.  Now I’m on a mission to do EVERYTHING I’ve always wanted to do. If you found out you were going to die tomorrow would you be happy with what you’ve accomplished or would you regret not doing certain things? Sorry for spamming I’m just trying to motivate people to do the things they’ve always wanted to. If you’re bored come see what I’ve done so far! Almost 1000 subscribers and I just started!
