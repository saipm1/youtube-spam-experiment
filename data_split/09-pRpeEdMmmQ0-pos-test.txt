O peoples of the earth, I have seen how you perform every form of evil at your leisure! You cease not from reveling in that which I hate! Behold, you murder the innocent day and night and plot evil against your neighbor! You stand up for the rights of those who commit abomination and clap your hands as wickedness is celebrated openly in the streets!... O MOST PERVERSE AND ABOMINABLE GENERATION, SHALL I NOT REPAY?!  Hear the Word of The Lord - TrumpetCallOfGodOnline.  co m
I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS SONG IN MY LIFE LIKE THIS COMMENT OF YOUR HEARING THIS SONG FOR LIKE A YEAR!!!!!
