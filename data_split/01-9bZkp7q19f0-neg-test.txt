With the korean girl more slut and bitch : Hyuna :'33﻿
Still a very fun music video to watch! ﻿
C'mon 3 billion views!!!!!!!!﻿
Hey I think I know what where dealing with here!!!! I have some theories of  how this could've gotten 2billion hits!! 1. This was mabey made in korea and its realy popular there so they were  stuck watching this over and over again. 2. Over 2billion people have access to the Internet, including youtube, and  the numbers are rising, by 2017 half of the populatoin will be connected. 3. Hackers In Korea may have loved it so much they rised it to 2billion  hits to make it more popular.  4. The song was featured in a just dance game, on multiple mp3s, and been  seen on concerts and even on new years eve event in 2012, so just by seeing  those you mabey adding more hits to this video. 5. You are complaining to much on how the heck this has 2b hits.﻿
