TITLE: Why I love my Microsoft Surface RT
CONTENT: I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that my Surface was way better than all the reviews I've been seeing. In this video, I outline my favorite features including Xbox 360 controller integration, super nintendo emulators, Halo Spartan Assault, connecting to a TV and monitor via HDMI cable, multitasking, spotify web player, and connecting the logitech keyboard and mouse via the unifying USB dongle. Mind = blown!

Update: Be sure to watch the part 2 video too!

Update2: Some people asked about Gmail - so I made a short video: http://youtu.be/wP6GL0p1XhM
