TITLE: Microsoft Surface Pro Review
CONTENT: Lisa Gade reviews the MS Surface Pro Windows 8 tablet. The Surface Pro isn't just a tablet, it had the power of an Ultrabook inside with a 1.7GHz Intel Core i5 ULV CPU, 4 gigs of DDR3 RAM and a 64 or 128 gig SSD drive. The 10.6" multi-touch full HD display also works with the included Wacom pen for precise note taking and drawing. The 2 lb. Surface starts at $899 US for the 64 gig and the 128 gig is $999. It works with Microsoft's  Touch Cover and Type Cover (not included) that are compatible with Surface RT as well. The tablet runs Windows 8 Pro 64 bit, had dual band WiFi, Bluetooth and dual 720 cameras. In May 2013, Wacom finally released WinTAB drivers for the Surface Pro for those who need pen pressure sensitivity in Photoshop!
