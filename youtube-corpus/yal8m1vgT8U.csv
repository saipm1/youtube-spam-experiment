Thanks to your comment I realized that I should go for the ARM based Windows RT since Intel's Clovertrail will most likely struggle with heavy x86 apps and the fact that they are designed for 12 inch and up displays (esp x86 games).   I just realized﻿ that using apps from the Windows Store just makes more sense since they were designed to be used by 10inch and up displays  unlike most x86 ones.,406,0,playVideoOnDemand,playVideoOnDemand,UCWby5iKFkEvEEkYvaCFWe0A
