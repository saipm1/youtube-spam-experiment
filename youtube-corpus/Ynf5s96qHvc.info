TITLE: Midnight Meat Train!!   uncensored w/ Carrie Keagan!
CONTENT: Boys and girls, it's another episode of UP CLOSE with Carrie Keagan featuring Midnight Meat Train and today we hanging out at the NGTV Studio Bar, known as the Shark Tank, none other than the Vinnie Jones.
The Midnight Meat Train is a 2008 horror film based on Clive Barker's 1984 short story of the same name, which can be found in Volume One of Barker's collection Books of Blood. The film follows a photographer who attempts to track down a serial killer dubbed the "Subway Butcher" and discovers more than he bargained for under the city streets.
The film stars Bradley Cooper, Leslie Bibb, Brooke Shields, Roger Bart, and Vinnie Jones.  The film was directed by Japanese director Ryuhei Kitamura and stars Bradley Cooper, Leslie Bibb, Vinnie Jones and Brooke Shields. Its script was adapted by Jeff Buhler, the producer was Tom Rosenberg of Lakeshore Entertainment, and it was released on August 1, 2008.

Producer Joe Daley, a long time friend of Buhler's, brought the two writers together and helped develop the script, along with producers Anthony Diblasi and Jorge Saralegui, for their newly minted horror factory The Midnight Picture Company. As of this entry, The Midnight Picture Company was busy shooting Book of Blood, the next film adaptation from the anthology of short stories that spawned Midnight Meat Train.
Photographer Leon goes into the city's subway system at night to take photographs. He saves a woman who is attacked by a gang by pointing out the videocamera. This young woman goes missing by the next day. Leon later finds clues in the photos he has taken that lead him to discover that butcher Mahogany is involved and may be a serial killer, and that there have been people going missing in the subway for at least a hundred years. Leon's involvement quickly turns into a dark obsession, upsetting Maya and leading her into her own investigations when Leon returns home severely wounded.

Maya and an acquaintance named Jurgis investigate the butcher using the photographs Leon has been taking. After breaking and entering the butcher's home, Jurgis is captured. The police will not believe Maya's story, and the police's involvement with the butcher is revealed when a policewoman leads a misguided Maya onto the late train. Leon, unaware of Maya's involvement, prepares himself to kill the butcher and end the horror. The climactic battle ensues and Mahogany is killed, but Leon and Maya find that the bodies being slaughtered are actually food for dark, unnamed creatures at the end of the track. A supernaturally strong train conductor murders Maya while a wounded Leon watches on, and then forces Leon into slavery as the new butcher. The last scene has Leon wearing a ring with eight stars, the same ring Mahogany had. A television reports an European union conference as the policewoman sends Leon off for the day, hinting at international involvement in some type of cult.
