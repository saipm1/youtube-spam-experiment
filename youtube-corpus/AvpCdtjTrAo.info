After getting a deeper hands-on with the PlayStation 4 and its very thorough tech demo today, The Playroom, we wanted to show you how all the bells and whistles of the new console, its new controller and the new PlayStation 4 Eye.

If you're looking for a thorough walkthrough of the various new PlayStation hardware, look no further.
