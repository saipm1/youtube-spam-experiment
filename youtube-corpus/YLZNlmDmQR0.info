TITLE: iPhone 5C vs iPhone 5
CONTENT: The iPhone 5s may be getting all the attention these days, but there's a bevy of multicolored iPhones that deserve some words of their own. Fortunately, we're dedicated wordsmiths around these parts, and we're pretty keen on comparison videos as well.

We unboxed the iPhone 5c last week, and in the midst of flying bubble-wrap and packing tape torn asunder, we promised a followup series of features and reviews. While the latter segment is still being worked on, we've already managed to churn out a few comparisons, and you're looking at the latest of the bunch.

Besides the manifold salient dilemmas cris-crossing the blogosphere with regard to the higher-end iPhones, one of the most-pressing (and, oddly, most-ignored) has been "iPhone 5 vs iPhone 5c." The fact that Apple's mid-tier iPhone push is new and exotic shouldn't detract from the validity of a very pressing question: plastic or aluminum? Old-and-proven, or new-and-novel? Straight-laced reliability, or unproven customizability?

Join us for our latest comparison as we unlock the answers to some of these questions (or at least give you a peek at some possible solution), then stay tuned for our iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s reviews coming later this week!
